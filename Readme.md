**Package** is a container that holds die and was connected to outside (external device) by using wire bonding.
Example of package - Quadruple in-line package (QIP) and Dual in-line package (DIP).

**Quad Flat Package(QFP)**-A quad flat package (QFP) is a surface-mounted integrated circuit package with "gull wing" leads extending from each of the four sides.

**Wafer Level Chip Scale Package (WLCSP)** - variant of the flip-chip interconnection technique where all packaging is done at the wafer level

* **Wire Bond** - The method of making interconnections between an integrated circuit (IC) or other semiconductor device and its packaging during semiconductor device fabrication.
* **Pad** - used to connect inside (core) to outside (I/O), good at ESD protection to prevent charge coming from outside damage the core inside.
* **Core** - consists of all the main logic gate (NMOS/PMOS) and cell block such as macro cell and foundry IP's.
* **I/O** - help in communication between die with external and will be connected to die by using wire bonding.
* **Macro** - a simple core/cell with simple functionality and can be easily found online.
* **Foundry IP's** - cell with more specific functionality and the design was patent/owned by a company. Has higher value compared to macro.

**Synthesis Flow** - convert software's instructions which is written in high level language to gate level language/machine language which is normally in binary format.
