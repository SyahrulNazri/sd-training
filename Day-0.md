### Topic - System/Tool Setup Check. GitHub ID creation

**Package** is a container that holds die and was connected to outside (external device) by using wire bonding.
Example of package - Quadruple in-line package (QIP) and Dual in-line package (DIP).

**Wafer Level Chip Scale Package (WLCSP)** - variant of the flip-chip interconnection technique where all packaging is done at the wafer level

* **Pad** - used to connect inside (core) to outside (I/O), good at ESD protection to prevent charge coming from outside damage the core inside.
* **Core** - consists of all the main logic gate (NMOS/PMOS) and cell block such as macro cell and foundry IP's.
* **I/O** - help in communication between die with external and will be connected to die by using wire bonding.

+ **Differences of macro vs foundry IP's**:
  * **Macro** - a simple core/cell with simple functionality and can be easily found online.
  * **Foundry IP's** - cell with more specific functionality and the design was patent/owned by a company. Has higher value compared to macro.

How does a **software communicate with hardware**:

**Synthesis process** will help to convert software's instructions which is written in high level language to gate level language/machine language which is normally in binary format.

**Synthesis process flow**:
1. **Specification/instructions** written in RTL (**high-level language** such as C, C++ or Java) as inputs.
1. **Compiler** will compile the instruction into **assembly language** (.exe).
1. **Assembler** will then convert **assembly language** into **gate level language** (low-level language.machine language) which is in binary format (operands), and it is the language understood by a computer.
