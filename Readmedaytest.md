 Package it is the material that contains semiconductor device attached with a die using wire bonding. Package is a container that holds die and was connected to outside (external device) by using wire bonding. Example of package - Quadruple in-line package (QIP) and Dual in-line package (DIP).  
   
- Wire Bond - The method of making interconnections between an integrated circuit (IC) or other semiconductor device and its packaging during semiconductor device fabrication.
- Pad - used to connect inside (core) to outside (I/O), good at ESD protection to prevent charge coming from outside damage the core inside.
- Core - consists of all the main logic gate (NMOS/PMOS) and cell block such as macro cell and foundry IP's.
- I/O - help in communication between die with external and will be connected to die by using wire bonding.
- Macro - a simple core/cell with simple functionality and can be easily found online.
- Foundry IP's - cell with more specific functionality and the design was patent/owned by a company. Has higher value compared to macro.

 <summary>Introduction to RISC-V</summary>
 
 Process of converting RISC-V architecture to layout 
 
  1) C++ codes will be compiled in RISC-V assembly language program.
  2) This assembly language will convert the code to the machine language which is binary language that containing logc 0 and logic .This binary language only              undertstood by the computer and it will be used to sketched in a layout by the computer program and we will get the required output.
  3) But another interface also played their role between architecture and layout of RISC-V which is Hardware Description LAnguage(HDL) where it used implementing the        specification of RISC-V.

 <summary>From Software Aplications to Hardware</summary>
 
 **Flow fo The Synthesis Process**
 - Software(HLL) --> System Sofware(aseembly Language) --> Hardware(machine language)
 - Essentially, the application software would enter the system software's clock, and the system software would turn the application programme into binary code.
 -  The Operating System (OS) is a major process in system software that takes specific applications and converts them into relevant assembly language programmes and      binary programmes so that the programme may be understood by the hardware.
 - The transformed binary language/machine language is fed into the hardware, which produces the output.
 
 - Operating Systems (OS) --> Handle IO operations,allocate memory and low level system functions
 - Compiler --> Cenverting the programming language intro the respective instructions.The syntax instruction is depending upon what kind of the hardware belong to        RISc_V format,the syntax would haev the syntax of RISC-V format instructions.
 - Assembler --> take particular instructions and convert it into the respective binary number which is machine language program.
